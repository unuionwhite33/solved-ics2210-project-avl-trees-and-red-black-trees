• Write a command line program with the following behaviour.• Let � be a random number between 1000 and 3000.• Create a set � containing � integers. Each integer must be a randomnumber in the range −3000 and +3000. Make sure that there are noduplicates in this set.Set X contains ??? elements• Let � be a random number between 500 and 1000.• Create a second set � containing � integers. Each integer must be arandom number in the range −3000 and +3000. Make sure that there areno duplicates in this set.Set Y contains ??? elements• Note that the sets X and Y may have elements in common.Sets X and Y have ??? elements in common• Insert all the elements in the set X into an AVL tree and into a Red-Blacktree. Both are binary search trees. The AVL tree and Red-Black treeimplementations must be your own.• After inserting all the values into each tree, you must show: the number ofrotations performed in total, the height of the tree, the number of nodes inthe tree, and the number of comparison operations (left/right decisions)made in total.AVL: ?? tot. rotations req., height is ??, #nodes is ??, #comparisons is ??RBT: ?? tot. rotations req., height is ??, #nodes is ??, #comparisons is ??• Delete all the elements in the set Y from the AVL tree and from the Red&#x2;Black Tree. After deleting all the values into each tree, you must show: thenumber of rotations performed in total, the height of the tree, the numberof nodes in the tree, and the number of comparison operations (left/rightdecisions) made in total.AVL: ?? tot. rotations req., height is ??, #nodes is ??, #comparisons is ??RBT: ?? tot. rotations req., height is ??, #nodes is ??, #comparisons is ??• Let � be a random number between 1000 and 2000.• Create a third set � containing � integers. Each integer must be a randomnumber in the range −3000 and +3000. Make sure that there are noduplicates in this set.• Search for every element in the set � in both the AVL tree and the Red&#x2;Black tree. Note that a search may be successful or not.k is ???AVL: ??? total comparisons requiredRBT: ??? total comparisons required• In your report, write a high-quality discussion comparing AVL trees toRed-Black trees. In this section, make sure to discuss the suitability ofeach method in real-world applications.Statement of completion – MUST be included in your reportItem Completed (Yes/No/Partial)AVL tree (insert, delete, search)Red-Black tree (insert, delete, search)Discussion comparing AVL to RBTIf partial, explain what has been done
